# Azure DevOps Zero to Hero

> A complete, beginner-friendly course to master Azure DevOps — from planning to deployment.

Build, test, and deploy a real-world application using every core Azure DevOps service. By the end of this course, you'll have a fully working CI/CD pipeline that deploys a containerized app to an Azure VM.

## What You'll Learn

- Set up an Azure DevOps organization and project from scratch
- Plan work using **Azure Boards** (Kanban, sprints, user stories)
- Manage code with **Azure Repos** (Git, PRs, branch policies)
- Build CI/CD pipelines with **Azure Pipelines** (YAML, multi-stage)
- Deploy to an **Azure VM** using a **self-hosted agent**
- Containerize apps with **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- Explore **Azure Artifacts**, **Test Plans**, dashboards, and security
- (Bonus) Provision infrastructure with **Terraform**

## The Project: SkillPulse

Throughout this course, we build **SkillPulse** — a Skill Tracker / Learning Dashboard where you can:

- Track skills you're learning (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Go, etc.)
- Log study sessions with hours and notes
- View your progress with visual dashboards

**Think of it as your personal GitHub contribution graph, but for learning.**

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | Go (Gin framework) |
| Frontend | HTML / CSS / JavaScript |
| Database | MySQL 8.0 |
| Web Server | Nginx (reverse proxy) |
| Containers | Docker + Docker Compose |
| CI/CD | Azure Pipelines (YAML) |
| Deployment | Azure VM + Self-hosted Agent |

## Prerequisites

- A free [Azure DevOps account](https://dev.azure.com) (we'll set this up in Chapter 1)
- A free [Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) (for the VM in Chapter 7)
- Basic familiarity with Git (clone, commit, push)
- Basic understanding of what Docker does (we'll cover the rest)
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)
- A terminal (any OS works — Windows, macOS, Linux)

**No prior Azure or Azure DevOps experience needed. We start from zero.**
